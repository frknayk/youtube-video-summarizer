     The podcast discusses the importance of baseline dopamine levels for motivation and goal-oriented behavior. The host explains that without a sufficient level of baseline dopamine, individuals may struggle to feel motivated or have the energy to pursue their goals. He highlights four foundational practices that can help maintain a healthy level of baseline dopamine:

1. Getting sufficient sleep each night, which restores dopamine reserves and allows for peak performance.
2. Engaging in non-sleep deep rest (NSDR), a practice similar to yoga nidra, which can increase dopamine levels by up to 65%.
3. Proper nutrition, including foods high in tyrosine, the amino acid necessary for dopamine synthesis.
4. Morning sunlight exposure, which increases cortisol levels early in the day and triggers a dopamine-related cascade in neuromodulators, hormones, and mood.

The host also emphasizes the importance of regular exercise, which can increase levels of baseline dopamine through engagement in movement and maintenance of the circuits in the brain and body that generate movement. He notes that there is variation in baseline dopamine levels based on genetics and circumstance, but everyone needs to engage in the foundational practices to maintain a healthy level of dopamine.
