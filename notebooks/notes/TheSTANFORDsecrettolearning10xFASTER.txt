     The author is trying to learn faster by following a system developed by Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman. The system involves incorporating short breaks, known as the Gap effect, into study sessions to improve retention and focus. The author has found that taking 10-second breaks every hour, focusing on a single point for 30-60 seconds, limiting study sessions to 90 minutes, and practicing non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) after studying have been helpful in improving their learning speed. The author also mentions that getting alert, getting focused, and sleeping well that night are the most essential steps in the system, but the specific techniques used can vary depending on individual preferences and routine.
