     The speaker argues that the conventional wisdom on success, such as waking up early, removing distractions, and having goals, is overrated and not the key to success. Instead, he suggests that being a correct contrarian and having unpopular beliefs is more important. He cites examples of successful people throughout history who had contrarian ideas that were initially ridiculed but ultimately proved to be correct. The speaker also acknowledges that executing on those ideas is important, but it's not sufficient on its own. He suggests that finding one correct contrarian idea can have a significant impact on a person's career, more than any other factor. However, he also notes that extreme success can have negative consequences, such as a lack of validation and approval from others, and that it may not improve relationships that don't need improvement.

The speaker emphasizes that being correctly contrarian is not a guarantee of success, and that most contrarian beliefs are contrarian for a reason, because they are wrong. He notes that many people have tried these ideas and failed miserably, and have spent the rest of their lives wondering what they were thinking. The speaker suggests that success amplifies who you already are and how you already feel, so people who are angry and depressed may become even angrier and more depressed with success, while those with great relationships may see their relationships improve even more.

The speaker concludes that extreme success is not the ultimate goal, and that it is more important to focus on finding a correct contrarian idea that is important to you, rather than trying to become more successful than 99% of people. He suggests that before pursuing success, it is important to define what success means to you, and to make sure that you are setting the right goals for yourself.
